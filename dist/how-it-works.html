      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>When you first load the application, you are prompted to specify a station for your morning and for your
        evening CTA 'L' Train commute. This assumes you use the same stations every day. We are aware that this is not
        the case for all commuters, but the application is currently under rapid development and we will make changes
        based on feedback. We make it easy to change the target station. With one click, you can instantly search every
        station in the 'L' system. </p>

      <h3>Lightweight for mobile</h3>
      <p>The application works on desktop and mobile. If it needs to be optimized for your screen size, please submit
        feedback with the make and model as well as screen size of your phone. We have built it to be lightweight, to
        use a limited amount of data and battery, and to be quick to refresh. How much data are we talking? We will
        further optimize it, but right now, a page load is 12.5kb and a full refresh is ~62kb. Put in perspective,
        sending one smartphone picture uses about 3MB of data (rough estimate) so you can refresh this app 250 times
        before you've used roughly the same amount of data.</p>

      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>All your data is stored locally on your device. We currently store nothing about you. None of your data
        touches our servers. We value your privacy and will let you know if this changes. Because of this if you open
        this app in an incognito window, or clear your cache when you return, it will be reset.</p>
